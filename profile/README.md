Building tools and infrastructure that matter.

## What We're About

We focus on creating practical, developer-friendly solutions that solve real problems. Our work spans from automation and tooling to exploring the cutting edge of AI infrastructure.

## Current Focus

### Developer Experience
Streamlining workflows, automating the boring stuff, and making development more productive. If it can save time or reduce friction, we're interested.

### Infrastructure & Tooling
Building robust systems that developers can rely on. We believe in tools that work quietly in the background, doing their job without getting in the way.

## What's in the Pipeline

### 🔬 Exploring Local AI
We're diving deep into running AI models locally—no cloud dependencies, complete privacy, full control. Think powerful language models running on your own hardware, with an emphasis on:

- **Performance optimization** for consumer hardware
- **Seamless developer experience** (because if it's hard to use, what's the point?)
- **Privacy-first architecture** (your data stays yours)
- **Practical tooling** that actually integrates with real workflows

This is early-stage exploration, but the goal is clear: make local AI as accessible and powerful as cloud-based solutions, without the trade-offs.

## Philosophy

**Simple over clever.** We prefer solutions that are maintainable and clear over those that are merely impressive.

**Developer-centric.** If developers don't want to use it, we didn't build it right.

**Open by default.** Share knowledge, contribute back, make things better for everyone.
