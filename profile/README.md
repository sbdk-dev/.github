## 🎯 What We Do

At [sbdk-dev](https://sbdk.dev), we create developer tools and infrastructure that solve real problems without unnecessary complexity. Our projects span automation, workflow optimization, and cutting-edge AI infrastructure—all with a focus on making developers' lives easier.

We believe the best tools are the ones you don't have to think about. They work reliably, respect your privacy, and integrate seamlessly into your existing workflows.

## 🚀 Current Focus Areas

### Developer Experience & Automation
We're passionate about eliminating repetitive tasks and streamlining development workflows:

- **CI/CD Optimization** - Making build and deployment pipelines faster and more reliable
- **Developer Tooling** - CLI tools, scripts, and utilities that save time every day
- **Workflow Automation** - GitHub Actions, bots, and integrations that reduce manual work
- **Documentation Systems** - Because good docs are infrastructure too

**Philosophy:** If a task takes more than 2 minutes and you do it more than twice, it should be automated.

### Infrastructure & Systems
Building robust, maintainable systems that developers can depend on:

- **Container Orchestration** - Docker, Kubernetes, and efficient deployment strategies
- **Monitoring & Observability** - Understanding what your systems are doing without drowning in data
- **API Design & Development** - Clean, well-documented APIs that are a joy to use
- **Performance Engineering** - Making things fast without making them complicated

**Goal:** Infrastructure that works quietly in the background, doing its job without getting in the way.

## 🔬 What's Coming: The Future of Local AI

We're deep in exploration mode on something exciting: **making powerful AI models run locally, on your hardware, with zero cloud dependencies.**

### Why Local AI Matters

Cloud-based AI is convenient, but it comes with trade-offs:
- Your data leaves your machine
- You're dependent on external services
- Costs scale with usage
- Privacy concerns in regulated industries

We're building toward a future where you get the power of state-of-the-art language models without sacrificing control, privacy, or breaking the bank.

### What We're Exploring

**🔧 Hardware Optimization**
- Running 7B-70B parameter models efficiently on consumer GPUs
- Quantization strategies that maintain quality while reducing memory footprint
- CPU inference optimization for scenarios where GPU isn't available
- Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) specific optimizations

**🎨 Developer Experience**
- One-command setup that just works
- Drop-in API compatibility with popular cloud providers
- Intelligent model management and caching
- Real-time performance monitoring and resource usage

**🔒 Privacy-First Architecture**
- Everything runs on your infrastructure
- No telemetry, no phone-home, no data collection
- Complete control over model selection and behavior
- Ideal for sensitive codebases, regulated industries, or anyone who values privacy

**🔌 Practical Integration**
- IDE extensions for VS Code, Vim, and more
- CLI tools for terminal workflows
- REST APIs for custom integrations
- Git hooks and automation scripts

**📊 Real-World Performance**
- Inference speeds competitive with cloud solutions
- Efficient batching for high-throughput scenarios
- Smart context management for long conversations
- Resource scheduling to prevent system slowdown

### The Vision

Imagine working on a sensitive project where code never leaves your machine. Or building AI-powered tooling without worrying about API costs scaling. Or having full control over model behavior and responses.

That's what we're working toward: **local AI that's as powerful and convenient as cloud solutions, but with complete privacy and control.**

This is early-stage exploration, but we're committed to sharing our findings, benchmarks, and eventually, the tools themselves.

## 💡 Our Philosophy

### Simple Over Clever
We prefer solutions that are maintainable and clear over those that are merely impressive. Code that's easy to understand is code that's easy to fix, extend, and hand off.

### Developer-Centric Design
If developers don't want to use it, we didn't build it right. Every decision prioritizes the developer experience—from API design to documentation to error messages.

### Open by Default
Share knowledge, contribute back to the community, make things better for everyone. Open source isn't just about code; it's about sharing what we learn along the way.

### Privacy & Control Matter
Your code, your data, your infrastructure. We build tools that respect your privacy and give you complete control over where your data goes and how it's used.

### Performance Is a Feature
Fast tools are productive tools. We optimize for speed without sacrificing clarity or maintainability.
